* how to setup taffybar:
** install stack manually:
   this depends on the OS, but the easiest is probably just to install manually:
   wget https://get.haskellstack.org/stable/linux-x86_64.tar.gz
   mv linux-x86_64.tar.gz stack-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
   mkdir -p stack && cd stack
   mv ../stack-linux-x86_64.tar.gz ./
   tar xvf stack-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
   cd stack-*linux-x86_64/	# replace * with stack version or let bash do it for you
   cp stack $HOME/.local/bin/	# assuming $HOME/.local/bin/ is in the PATH
   stack setup
   stack upgrade

** install taffybar from it's git:
   # I've verified the below snippet lastly at 2019-04-20
   curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taffybar/taffybar/master/quick-start.sh | bash

** install stack run
   this works only on older versions of stack (at least by the time of writing this doc)
   latest working version that I know of is lts-11.16 so make sure the
   stack global-stack-project yaml is set to this version

** use the config:
   copy taffybar.hs and stack.yaml to $HOME/.config/taffybar/ and run:
   cd $HOME/.config/taffybar/
   # this might need to change to my-taffybar not sure yet
   stack run taffybar
